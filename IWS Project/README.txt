Abstract:
In this paper, we introduce a platform that simplifies the complex process of car financing decisions. Our platform uses a set of user-friendly questions to gather information from customers. Based on this information, it compares lease and loan options to provide personalized recommendations that align with their financial circumstances and preferences. Our research shows that personalized guidance can lead to financial savings and reduced decision-related stress, offering a more transparent approach to car financing.

The proposed technology stack consists of web development frameworks, including JavaScript with Vue.js for the frontend, and MySQL for managing the database. Vue.js enables the creation of a user-friendly and interactive interface, while MySQL efficiently stores and manages data required for personalized recommendations. Python will serve as the backend. This stack ensures a responsive and intuitive user experience by aligning individual user data with financing options, enabling them to make informed and optimized decisions.
